        <dt> respiratory system</dt>
              nervous system
              digestive system 

              <dd>respiratory sytem:It executes the gas exchange between cells and the environment and includes trachea and lungs. 
               <dt> The respiratory system takes oxygen from the environment and converts it into a form that cells can use.
                <dt> it means that our lungs take in oxygen, and rapidly diffuse it into the blood.Without oxygen to fuel cellular respiration, cells begin to die within minutes.
               <dt></dt> Thus, the respiratory system is one of the bodyâ€™s most important system.
                <dd> Without oxygen to fuel cellular respiration, cells begin to die within minutes.

     <dt></dt> nervous system:This system allows perception, emotion, thought, and rapid response to the environment. It includes the brain and nerves.
 The nervous system allows us to sensory stimuli such as light, sound, smell, and touch from our environment

        <dd>It also allows rapid communication of stimuli within our body, such as sensations of pain, illness, and wellness. 
           <dt></dt> The nervous system accomplishes all of this using highly specialized cells called neurons,
            <dt></dt> which can transmit signals extremely fast by firing electrochemical potentials

             <dd>didestive system:This system intakes food, breaks it down into usable nutrients and excretes solid waste products.
               <dt></dt> It includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines.
              <dt></dt> One of the most important purposes of food is to serve as cellular fuel.

                <dd>digestive system also Also, carbohydrates,proteins, 
                   <dt></dt> and fats can all be used by our cells as sources of the energy that they need to stay alive.
